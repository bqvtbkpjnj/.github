Wow, just wow... just walked out of Snowhite. Theater so loud, can’t hear my own thoughts... popcorn everywhere, sticky floor like glue, crumbs in places crumbs shouldn’t be. Back feels like it got tangled with the dwarves’ pickaxes. Man, those seats are anti-back friendly like Monday morning traffic. 

Mirror talkin back, always made me think of the GPS inside the bus... rerouting your life like a fairytale map. And that queen, ufff, she’s like a crazy lady yelling about fares being too high while I’m just trying to get folks to the next stop. Apple’s should come with warning, like labels words you can't read in the dark.

> Haha, those dwarves though. Seriously like a bizarre lot of passengers, each with their quirks, grumpy like George the old-timer who rides every Wednesday. Wish they’d get their own seat too, maybe Bus Company might sponsor 'em. Can never name all seven correctly, like trying to count exact change for a dollar fifty while driving.

Think someone wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie, it makes you think, why not? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie twice, thrice, those colors so bright could guide a bus in fog.

The prince seemed less like a hero, more like that guy who always wants off at the unplanned bus-stop. Never saw him check a map once. Might as well have just stumbled out from the woods after a long shift on the road.

Snow White’s voice, like coffee on a clear dawn patchy cloud kinda dayall sweet and calming but keeps you buzzing. Music rings in head like never-ending driver’s horn when the light turns green.

Magic charm of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 hits like bus doors closing too quickly. But Life at the depot, at the benches, sometimes you need a little magic reboot after a long route.

Try to remember the time a kid left a red apple slice on the seat once. Always thought it'd summon birds to clean up. Nature calls but service toll's high.

if(awedByFairytale) {
   isHappy = true;
   takesBusHome();
   continuesDriving = true;
} else {
   // Rewrite fairytales tomorrow
}

All said and done, I’m gonna dream of trying to reroute around these characters tonight... this day was less a happily-ever-after, more a surprising detour.
